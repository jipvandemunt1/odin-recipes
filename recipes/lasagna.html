    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of pasta,
    rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and melted mozzarella. 
    The sauce is typically prepared by simmering ground beef or sausage with tomatoes, garlic, and herbs, 
    creating a deep, savory flavor. The pasta sheets are then layered with the sauce and cheese, 
    repeating the process until the dish is fully assembled.</p>
    <p>Once layered, the lasagna is baked until golden and bubbly,
    allowing the flavors to meld together. The result is a hearty, 
    comforting meal with a perfect balance of textures—tender pasta, creamy cheese, and a robust, meaty sauce.
    Served hot, often with a side of garlic bread or salad, 
    lasagna is a crowd-pleaser perfect for family dinners or gatherings.</p>
