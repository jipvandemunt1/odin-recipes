    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Spaghetti is a classic Italian pasta dish loved for its simplicity and versatility. 
        Made from long, thin strands of pasta, it pairs perfectly with a variety of sauces, 
        from rich and meaty Bolognese to light and fresh tomato or garlic-based sauces. Traditionally, 
        spaghetti is cooked in boiling salted water until al dente, 
        ensuring a firm yet tender texture that absorbs flavors well.

        Once drained, the pasta is often tossed with a savory sauce, 
        complemented by ingredients like olive oil, garlic, basil, or Parmesan cheese. 
        Whether served with a hearty meat sauce, creamy carbonara, or just a drizzle of olive oil and herbs, 
        spaghetti remains a comforting, satisfying meal enjoyed by people of all ages.
