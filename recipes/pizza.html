    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pizza is a beloved dish enjoyed worldwide, known for its crispy crust, 
        rich tomato sauce, and gooey melted cheese. Originating from Italy, 
        pizza has evolved into countless variations, 
        from the classic Margherita with fresh basil to meat-loaded options and veggie-packed delights. 
        The dough, typically made from flour, water, yeast, and olive oil,
        is stretched thin or kept thick, depending on regional styles.

        Once topped with ingredients like mozzarella, 
        pepperoni, mushrooms, or olives, 
        the pizza is baked in a high-temperature oven until golden and bubbly. 
        Whether enjoyed as a quick snack or a shared meal with friends and family, 
        pizza offers endless customization and flavors to suit any taste.
